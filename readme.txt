Before you try to run any of the build tasks (only test and deploy are really applicable for this project) make sure
you have ruby installed on your local machine. I would recommend running the ruby one click installer, unless you are
already familiar with setting up ruby on your local machine. You can download the one click installer from the following location:

http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/29263/ruby186-26.exe


*****All build activities are to be done with a command prompt that is pointing at the root folder******

To Test: build test

To Deploy: build deploy_assembly (output will go to the build\deploy folder)

To Open The Solutions: open (you don't have to use this, but if you do it will ensure that the TestDriven.Net runner uses the version
                             of MBUnit that lives in this project).
